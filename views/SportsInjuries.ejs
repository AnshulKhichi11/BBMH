            <h2>Shoulder Dislocation</h2>
            <p>A dislocated shoulder is an injury in which your upper arm bone pops out of the cup-shaped socket that’s part of your shoulder blade. The muscles in your shoulder may spasm from the disruption, often increasing the intensity of your pain. However, once you’ve had a dislocated shoulder, your joint may become unstable and be prone to repeat dislocations.</p>

            <h2>Synovitis Treatment</h2>
            <p>Synovitis is when the synovium of a joint becomes inflamed. synovial is the connective tissue that lines the inside of the joint capsule. A joint capsule is a bubble-like structure that surrounds joints such as the shoulder, elbow, knee, and ankle. It is composed of a tough, and a soft inside layer Contained inside both layers is synovial fluid, a viscous liquid that lubricates the joint to reduce friction on the articular cartilage during motion.</p>

            <h2>Cartilage Injury</h2>
            <p>Cartilage is a connective tissue found in many parts of the body. Although it is a tough and flexible material, it is relatively easy to damage. rubbery tissue acts as a cushion between the bones of joints. cartilage damage most commonly occurs in the knee, but the elbow, wrist, ankle, shoulder, and hip joint can also be affected.</p>

            <h2>Frozen Shoulder</h2>
            <p>Frozen shoulder, also known as adhesive capsulitis, is a condition characterized by stiffness and pain in your shoulder joint. Signs and symptoms typically begin gradually, worsen over time and then resolve, usually within one to three years. Treatment for frozen shoulder involves range-of-motion exercises and, sometimes, corticosteroids and numbing medications injected into the joint capsule.</p>
